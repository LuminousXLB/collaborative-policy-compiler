Most of the network devices are used simultaneously for public traffic forwarding and private traffic forwarding between trusted sites, so there is a possibility that the private traffic can be leaked to the public domain due to a policy inconsistency issue in each network device. So, there is requirement for a network administrator in each of the sites to ensure there is no such problematic policy in their devices.
